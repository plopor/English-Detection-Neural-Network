# English-Detection-Neural-Network
Made in python, this project is a neural network consisting of an input layer of 390 binary inputs, a hidden layer of 10 perceptrons, and one output perceptron that uses back-propagation to determine whether the input word is English or not. Currently being trained with a testing set of 2000 English and non-English entries of maximum 15 letters long, the neural net is able to build its synapse weights accordingly as it learns to guess the aspects that distinguish a valid word from gibberish. By increasing the testing set and iteration amount in future updates, the network will be able to improve the accuracy of its guesses.
