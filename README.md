# English-Detection-Neural-Network
Made in python, a neural net featuring one hidden layer that, having been trained, can identify whether a word is English or not.
Currently, uses a training set of a mere 60 words, half english, half not to build synapse weights. Iterates 4000 times on each word. Adding more iterations and more examples for training in the future to improve accuracy.
